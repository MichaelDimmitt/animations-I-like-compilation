It takes effort to appreciate darin's website: http://www.thedazzlingdman.com/
0) of course the animation that goes up down, left and right when scrolling.
1) grow + color, transparent overlay on the work section of the homepage 
2) references section does not have fencing ? <br/>
references section has animations with popups,<br/>
also an animation to lift arm up to ear.<br/>
also multipla animations can be occurring at one time.
3) Really nice transition changing the pixels for connected to not connected based on scroll when the elevator is going down.
4) Random Darin facts: another experiences driven design with pagination changing the characters clothes set.
5) awwward link is shown at starting place of home page but does not go down with scroll

3) 

Aside<br/>
2) use javascript to change mouse cursor ... based on horiizontal pixel of the screen.


Areas we could add some stuff, 
1) I like the personal room that has the computer and the space suits,<br/>
we could add some stuff to that, animations, customization, links, experiences, etc.
2) pacman machine should play pacman, right? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Question, "Are there any easter eggs?"
